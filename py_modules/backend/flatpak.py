"""flatpak.py — list/check/update Flatpak apps via the `flatpak` CLI.

Shells out rather than binding libflatpak (the approach Bazaar itself
uses under the hood): same operations, no GObject-introspection
dependency in a plugin's Python backend. Covers both installations —
`--system` (this is where Discover/KDE and `sudo flatpak install` land
apps) and `--user` — since either can hold apps the user cares about.

Update detection: `flatpak list` has no `--updates` flag (that's a
libflatpak-only concept — `FlatpakInstallation.list_installed_refs_
for_update()`, which is what Bazaar and GNOME Software actually call;
the CLI never exposed an equivalent, confirmed against Flatpak 1.18's
own --help, which lists no such option). The CLI-only substitute used
here: read each installed app's short `active` commit from `flatpak
list`, then compare it against the remote's current `Commit:` via
`flatpak remote-info` (a plain read, no elevated privileges needed
even for --system, and no local appstream/summary refresh required —
it queries the remote directly).
